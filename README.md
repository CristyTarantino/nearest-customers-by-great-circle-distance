# The Test
   ####1. Technical problem

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. 
We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. 
Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
 * You must use the first formula from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to
  calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians. 
 * The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.339428, -6.257664. 
 * You can find the Customer list in the file
  `customers.txt`.
 
We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program. 
Good submissions are well composed. 
Calculating distances and reading from a file are separate concerns. 
Classes or functions have clearly defined responsibilities. 
Poor submissions will be in the form of one big function. 
Itâ€™s impossible to test anything smaller than the entire operation of the program, including reading from the input file.

Here are some guidelines when approaching the submission:
* Submit code as if you intended to ship it to production.
* Use whatever language you feel strongest in. It doesn't have to be one we use.

Each submission must meet the following requirements:
* Submit your grade via a service like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.
* Code must be tested.
* Please include the output of your program with your submission in a separate file, e.g., output.txt.
* A file explaining how to install, how to execute the code and how to run tests. 
We may not be familiar with the language/framework you used and this helps us to evaluate it.

####2. Proudest Achievement
What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. 
Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.
