My proudest achievement it has been the React Native apps we have delivered to our client.
The apps allow users with EV vehicles to charge their cars paying "wireless".
Plus allows them to get to the nearest EV charging point.
This is a great step forward for a growing and green market, 
plus I have had to make it work with a Drupal backend which is now my choice and quite intricate.
It has been challenging, but great learning experience, and it never ends.
Every day there is always something exciting to learn about those techs and how they can work together.
